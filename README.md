# Asp.Net-Core-Identity-Multitenancy
Asp.Net Identiy 3.0 with Multitenancy support

This is my first shot trying to implement mulititenancy in Asp.Net Core Identity 3.0. After browsing the Asp.Net Core Identity code on Asp.Net Core Identity for a while and adding token base authentication from here AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server it was not that difficult. At the end it was much easier than for the previous version of Asp.Net Identity (v2.2). Check out the code. I will add comments later.
